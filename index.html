                                    <p> Hello there, my name is Randy Vaca I am born and raised in Dallas, TX. I am currently working as a crew leader technician in vehicle upfitting for the past year at Pursuit Safety Inc. in Royse City, TX. I have had the
                                        opportunity to work in various industries and professions that have allowed me to gain numerous skills and has made me into an adaptable individual. My very first job was as a cashier at Walgreens where learned
                                        money handling, problem solving, sales techniques, and communication skills. Following my cashier job, I move into the warehouse department I picked up organizing, numeracy, and time management skills. The skills
                                        I learned were very helpful when I was given a chance to work as a pharmacy technician in the pharmacy department all the skills mention previously were involved in my success as a pharmacy tech. My basic skills
                                        were pushed to the limits and beyond while attending various patients and processing their prescriptions. Now I have joined my skills and education into a new journey where I am transitioning from a daily job to
                                        a career in web development. I am currently working with HTM, CSS, and JavaScript my goal is to become a full stack developer. I am interested in obtaining a position that will allow me to improve my current programming
                                        communication, and teamwork skills.</p>
