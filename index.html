                                    <p> As a Web Developer who has established back end and front-end developing skills in order to help organizations build better web solutions. 
                                        As of now I have obtained an Associate in Science and have finished my Coding Boot Camp course at SMU University to acquire my Full Stack Developer certification. 
                                        I have currently developed skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, APIs, Node.js, Express.js, Express-HandleBars.js MySQL. 
                                        My goal is to keep developing my skills in Web Development. My skills stand out in debugging code as errors arise, organizing code so that it is readable and working efficiently, and also creating easy to use features for interface users. 
                                        In my previous years, I worked as a cashier at Walgreens where I sought the opportunity to grow within the company and as an individual building character. 
                                        I am motivated by the opportunity to be proactively working together as a team and contributing to something greater than myself. 
                                        After a few years at Walgreens, I transitioned into the pharmacy as a pharmacy tech, skills such as self-reliance, interpersonal, problem solving, and teamwork skills are what my superiors saw in me when I was offered that opportunity. 
                                        With the skills that I have acquired throughout the years from my previous occupations and the new skills in web development. 
                                        I seek out an environment where I can successfully apply all that I have gained, to continue pushing the envelope and keep learning from senior developers in order to be a Full Stack Developer and become part of a great team.
